## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible. âœ”

Your users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form âœ”
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form âœ”
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty âœ”
  - The email address is not formatted correctly âœ”
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size => Focused on 1440px, 768px and 375px width âœ”
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page âœ”

## My process

  - Built by following Figma design.
  - Built with HTML Semantic Elements and mobile first approach.
  - Used Internet for different code portions and customize code according to need.
  - Checked and verify good looking behaviour of developed pages by comparing to figma design.
  - Used chatGPT for code review.
  - Used google lighthouse.

    
### Continued development

  With the help of GROK AI I have found two screen readers(NVDA and VoiceOver). In future I will explore how to check/test accessibility.

## Acknowledgments

I have used Internet and chatGPT for different things. I believe it's fine to use Internet or chatGPT for help about something that we don't know. It's Good to take a portion of code from Internet, understand how it works and customize it as per our need.
